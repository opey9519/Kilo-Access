# 🏋️ USF Powerlifting Club Management System 🐂

A full-stack membership management system built for the University of South Florida Powerlifting Club, designed to securely manage equipment access and streamline officer administration.

## How it's made

**Technology**: Python (Flask), TypeScript (React), Docker, PostgreSQL  
**Deployment**: Azure Container Apps (Backend), Azure Static Web Apps (Frontend), Neon (Database)

The _USF Powerlifting Club_ Kilo Access web application is built to manage athlete access to over **$30,000 worth of specialized powerlifting equipment** at the Recreation & Wellness Center on the USF Tampa campus. The system empowers club officers (administrators) with secure authentication and role-based privileges, enabling them to seamlessly create, edit, and remove both athlete and administrator accounts. This design ensures smooth, autonomous management of access control, streamlining operations while maintaining accountability.

## Future Optimizations & Improvements

- QR Code Integration: Implementing downloadable, scannable QR codes linked to each athlete’s profile for use on physical athlete badges.
- Future Enhancements: Exploring deployment on a paid server to eliminate server spindown issues and ensure 100% uptime for a smoother user experience.
- Adding GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline. This automation significantly reduces manual errors, accelerates delivery times, and provides rapid feedback on code changes, ultimately enhancing development efficiency and software quality.
