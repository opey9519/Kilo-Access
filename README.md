## How it's made
**Technology**: Python (Flask), TypeScript (React), Docker, PostgreSQL  
**Deployment**: Render (Backend), Vercel (Frontend), Supabase (Database)

The _USF Powerlifting Club_ Kilo Access web application is built to manage athlete access to over **$20,000 worth of specialized powerlifting equipment** at the Recreation & Wellness Center on the USF Tampa campus.
